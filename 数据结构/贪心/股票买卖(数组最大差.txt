Leetcode 121

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock),
design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.


Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.


有O(n)的算法。维护一个当前值的最小值，和一个当前差值的最大值，差值的最大值的更新要看当前值和当前最小值的差值是否超过了此前的差值最大值。

class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int max_ = INT_MIN;
        int min_ = INT_MAX;
        for(int v: prices){
            min_ = min(min_,v);
            max_ = max(max_,v-min_);
        }
        if (max_ <= 0) return 0;
        return max_;
    }
};
